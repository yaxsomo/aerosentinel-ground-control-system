This repository is dedicated to the development of Aerosentinel Ground Control System.

## Introduction

AGCS is intended to be used as a Rocketry Ground Control Software for Aerosentinel Avionics. The objective is to have a unique interface to be able to gather telemetry data, video streams, send commands to the rocket, as well as monitoring the entire flight in a modern timeline, from ground to recovery.

## Features

- Features to be added

## Tech

AGCS is 100% based on the Swift programming language.

## Installing

Once the first release will be published, you'll just have to download it and execute it!

## System Requirements

In order to be able to execute this software the system requirements are the following :

-   Operating System : Mac OS Sonoma (14.0+)
-   RAM : 4Gb
-   Memory : At least 1Gb

## External Requirements 

As this software is compatible with Aerosentinel boards only, you'll need to have one of them, plus a long range radio module that interfaces with the software through USB (UART).
